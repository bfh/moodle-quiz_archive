Moodle quiz report plugin to achieve archiving your test, by printing out all attempts at once.


Requirements
------------

This plugin requires Moodle 3.9.


Motivation for this report
--------------------------

For some lecturers it is a good practice, that after an Moodle test they want to archive all student's attempts – i.e. print them all out or save them as PDF.
This plugin prints out the 'Review attempt' pages for each student in one single report.
The Moodle tracker issue linked is [MDL-45903](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-45903) – "A way to print or export the quiz responses of each student as a document".



Installation
------------

Install the plugin to folder
/mod/quiz/report/archive

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins
